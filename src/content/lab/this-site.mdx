## The Question

What does it look like to build something *with* AI rather than just *using* it? And in a world where AI makes everything polished, detailed, and complete—what's the value of sharing ideas that are still rough?

## What This Is

This site is two experiments running in parallel:

**An experiment in building.** The entire site was built using Claude Code as a collaborator—not generating code to copy-paste, but working together in conversation. Designing, iterating, debugging, rethinking. It's changed how I understand what "building" even means now.

**An experiment in sharing.** The thinking section isn't a blog. It's a place for ideas that aren't finished—notes, hunches, half-formed observations. The premise: in the age of AI, perfectly packaged content is abundant. What's scarce is the messy stuff. The things people are actually figuring out.

## What I'm Learning

Building with AI feels less like delegation and more like collaboration. The tool has opinions. It makes suggestions. Sometimes it's wrong in ways that clarify what I actually want. The process surfaces judgment in a way that solo building didn't.

And sharing rough ideas? It's uncomfortable. But it's also freeing. Not everything needs to be an essay. Sometimes a note is enough.

## Status

Active and evolving. The site will keep changing as the ideas do.
