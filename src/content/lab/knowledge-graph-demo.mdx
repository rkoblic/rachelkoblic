## The Question

What can knowledge graphs actually *do* for learning? Beyond the theoretical appeal of structured knowledge, how does it translate into something useful—like understanding why a student got an answer wrong?

## What This Does

This interactive demo walks through a six-step diagnostic process:

1. **Assessment Question** — A simple fraction identification problem
2. **Standard Identification** — Mapping the question to learning standards
3. **Learning Components** — Breaking the standard into atomic skills
4. **Gap Analysis** — Identifying which components are missing based on the response
5. **Prerequisite Trace** — Following the graph backward to find foundational gaps
6. **Targeted Intervention** — Surfacing exactly what to teach next

The visual knowledge graph lets you explore how prerequisites, standards, and components connect—making the diagnostic reasoning visible.

## What I'm Learning

Building this clarified how much structure is needed before "intelligent" diagnosis becomes possible. The graph isn't just a nice visualization—it's the reasoning substrate. Without explicit prerequisite relationships, you can't trace backward from a wrong answer to its root cause.

Also: the difference between "wrong" and "why wrong" is where the real value lives.

## Status

Exploratory demo. Testing whether this framing helps people understand what knowledge graphs make possible in education.
