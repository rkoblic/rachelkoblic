## The Question

What if learning didn't need a curriculum?

Most learning tools assume structure: objectives, sequences, assessments. But some of the richest learning happens through wandering—following a thread, noticing an unexpected connection, circling back to something with new eyes.

Can a tool support that kind of learning without flattening it into a syllabus?

## What This Does

Wayfinder starts with an "idea seed"—any concept you're curious about—and helps you explore laterally:

- **Lateral Connections** — Discover unexpected links between topics
- **Curiosity Map** — Visualize how your explorations connect
- **Thinking Patterns** — Surface your own cognitive tendencies through reflection
- **Self-Narrative** — Document insights and track your journey over time

The goal isn't to cover material efficiently. It's to honor how curiosity actually moves—in spirals, not straight lines.

## What I'm Learning

Building this has been a way of asking: what does it mean to *support* exploration without *directing* it? The tension between helpful structure and imposed structure is real. Too little scaffolding and the tool feels empty; too much and it starts feeling like school again.

## Status

Early experiment. Testing whether "curiosity-first" can be more than a philosophy—whether it can be a design pattern.
