## The Question

How might AI help people gain clarity on career direction—and identify the educational pathways that will actually get them there?

Career decisions are high-stakes but often made with limited information. Traditional assessments tell you what you might be suited for, but rarely connect that insight to concrete next steps: what to learn, what credentials matter, what paths others have taken.

## What This Does

This prototype uses AI to create a more integrated career exploration experience:

- Assesses interests, strengths, and values through conversational interaction
- Surfaces career directions that align with your profile
- Maps educational pathways—degrees, certifications, skills—that lead to those careers
- Connects the "what could I do?" with the "how do I get there?"

*Note: The AI needs a moment to think—give it a few seconds to respond.*

## What I'm Learning

Building this has surfaced interesting questions about how AI can (and can't) support high-stakes personal decisions. The conversational format feels more natural than traditional assessments, but calibrating confidence levels—when to suggest vs. when to caveat—remains tricky.

## Status

Early experiment. Exploring how to balance personalization with responsible guidance in career-adjacent AI tools.
