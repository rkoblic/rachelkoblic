## Key themes

**AI's current state** — Tracing the evolution from 1956 to ChatGPT's explosive growth, and where AI now matches (or exceeds) human performance.

**Opportunities** — Personalized tutoring, adaptive learning paths, instant feedback at scale. AI as a tool for meeting learners where they are.

**Challenges** — Hallucinations, bias, energy consumption. The risks we need to design around, not ignore.

**Faculty roles** — Augmented, not replaced. What new pedagogical competencies look like.

**Quality assurance** — How do we evaluate dynamic, AI-generated curriculum? Moving beyond product-based assessment.
