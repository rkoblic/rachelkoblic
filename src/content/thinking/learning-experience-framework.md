Presented at the ASU+GSV Summit in 2020, this talk introduces 2U's Learning Experience Framework—an evidence-based approach to learning design that distills decades of research and data from thousands of online courses.

The framework is built around three core elements: **Feel**, **Do**, and **Think**—a structure for designing digital education that's genuinely transformative, not just convenient.

I was a primary author on this framework during my time at 2U, where I grew the learning design team from under 10 to nearly 30 designers.
